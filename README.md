# FriendFinder

This activity is about building a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application. (Basically a dating app)

The application takes in results from users' surveys then compare their results against all other users who have completed it. The application will then display the name and picture of the user with the best match overall.

The application uses Express to handle routing and will deploy your application on Heroku so others can fill it out.
